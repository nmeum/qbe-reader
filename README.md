## QBE IR Parser for Rust

qbe-reader is a Rust parser for v1.1 of the intermediate language of the [QBE compiler backend][qbe web].
The parser is presently in very early stages of development.
Most of the syntax is support but only a handful of instructions are properly parsed presently.
For this reason, the API is not stable and still subject to change.

I am using this parser to develop a symbolic execution tool for QBE IL: https://github.com/nmeum/qsym

### Usage

The library is presently not available on crates.io.
However, for now it is possible to depend directly on the Git repository:

    [dependencies]
    qbe_reader = { git = "https://git.8pit.net/qbe-reader.git" }

Keep in mind though, that the API provided by qbe-reader is not yet stable though.
